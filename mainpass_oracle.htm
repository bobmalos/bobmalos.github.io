One of the most fundamental ways to secure institutional data is by changing your password regularly.  
Security policy agreements require you to change your IDEA password on a regular basis.  
Here are some password guidelines:
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1><OL>
<LI>IDEA passwords must be managed solely by the authorized user of the IDEA ID.
<LI>IDEA passwords must remain confidential.
<LI>IDEA passwords must be changed periodically (e.g. at least every 90 days) and any time there is reason to suspect a password has been compromised.
<LI>The best password is one that is not easily guessed but easy to remember.
<LI>Random alpha-numeric passwords or an unusual word or combination of letters and numbers are the best passwords.
<LI>Here are examples of password formats to <I>avoid</I>:
<UL>
<LI>Passwords that are easily associated with yourself,
    family or pet names, nicknames, birthdates or telephone numbers.
<LI>Passwords that are the month of the year or day of the week.
<LI>Passwords that are all the same letters or numbers.
<LI>Previously used passwords.
</UL>
<LI>Don't post your password on or near your computer workstation or in any unsecured location.
