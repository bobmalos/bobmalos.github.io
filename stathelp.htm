<HTML><TITLE>IDEA Web Status/History Page - HELP</TITLE>
<H3>What the heck is all that stuff on the Status/History Page ???</H3>
<B><UL>
<LI><I>Display Today's Session History</I> is a list of all the query building sessions that have run so far TODAY. It is 
in reverse chronological order (most recent session first). If at least one query has actually run for a session you can 
click on the session name to see the detail. The detail page will also be in reverse chronological order. At the bottom
of the page there is a ListBox that lets you look at the sessions for a previous day.
<br>This page is automatically rebuilt every 5 minutes (if you need a refresh right away you can go to:
http://notes.ais.umn.edu/runsession.htm)
<LI><I>Display Active Sessions</I> is a list of all the query building sessions (for TODAY) that have not yet expired
(their temporary files still exist). At the top of this page you can see the amount of space left on the disk drive
containing the Web Server. If that number is many hundreds of megabytes lower than normal then somebody probably ran
a monstrous query. The main purpose of this page is to let you PURGE sessions that should have expired or are taking
up too much space. <br>The list is in chronological order (most recent session at the bottom). Some of the active 
processes on the web server are also listed at the bottom of the page. Namely - DBMSWI32 (the conversion utility), ISQL 
(SYBASE queries), and PLUS33 (ORACLE queries). One reason that a session might not be deleted automatically is because
a conversion process got hung up - in this case you would KILL the DBMSWI32 process and then PURGE the session.
<LI><I>IMPORTANT NOTE!</I> - if the amount of space is low but you can't see any files displayed that are very large
you need to TELNET to 160.94.248.44 (the IP address of the web server machine) and delete the large file(s) out of
F:\INETPUB\ and maybe F:\INETPUB\WWWROOT\GODATA70\ (or you could go to the server room instead of TELNETing <I>OR you 
could just use the \\Dw_pws\Inetpub 'share'</I>
<LI><I>Display NT Services</I> is just that - it displays all the Services running on the Windows NT box where our
web server resides. If you want to actually STOP or START a service you would have to go the machine and bring up
'Control Panel' then 'Services'.
<LI><I>Display SYBASE and ORACLE Session Stats</I> shows the (non-system) sessions running on both SYBASE (zoom99.oit.umn.edu)
and ORACLE (DWPROD and also DWTEST). Here you can see whether one (or more) sessions is being a 'resource hog'. The 
'Host' column on the SYBASE display will reflect the Query Builder Sesssion name (if it's an IDEA Web query). The 'Host'
column on the SYBASE display will say 'FINRPTS' if it's a Production report from financial.reports.umn.edu and 'TFINRPTS'
if it's a Test report from financial.reports.umn.edu.
<LI><I>Query Builder Log Form</I> lets you do some ad-hoc queries against the Web Query Builder Archive (including the 
text of every web query ever run). The most powerful feature is the 'Query CONTAINS' box - you could enter something like
'CUFS_TRAN_OPEN_PDS and HE_DIS_ADJ_CU' to display all queries that referenced those 2 tables. You can also search based
on a User ID, a DATE or a DATE RANGE, or the time it took to run the query (e.g. anything greater than 599 seconds would
be over the 10 minute time limit)
You must enter your IDEA ID and Password to use this form.
<LI><I>Query Builder Maintenance Form</I> has several parts: <UL>
  <LI>Data Dictionary Form is for rebuilding the SYBASE individual column files (linked to from Query Form 4)
      <br>NOTE: For the Oracle Data Dictionary links you have to MANUALLY EDIT a few of the REXX scripts:
      <br>1) for QUERY_2O.REX and QUERY2OT.REX look for a line like:
      <br>WHEN Data_Base = 'PS_DWHR' THEN TOC_File = 'hrpsdic/Hr_ditoc.htm'
      <br>and make a new line for your new set of tables.
      <br>2) for QUERY_3O.REX and QUERY3OT.REX look for the lines that have 'PS_DWSA' in them and 
      <br>add a new condition for your new set of tables (e.g. add something like <br>" | SUBSTR(xTable,1,7) = 'PS_DWFA' " 
  <LI>SYBASE Table and Column Information Form is for rebuilding the table and column information for a 
      particular SYBASE database
      <br> NOTE: If something goes wrong (e.g. the wrong tables are added) you can RECOVER the table and column information
      files by going to the DBFNDX.ZIP archive in \\DW_FILE_PRINT\DW_SHARE\WEB_SERVER_BACKUPS\ and extracting the following
      7 files: TABLES.DBF, TABLES.NDX, TAB_COL.NDX, COLUMNS.DBF, COLUMN.NDX, COL_SORT.DBF, COL_SORT.NDX; then just copy
      them back over to the F:\INETPUB\CGI-REXX directory on the web server.
  <LI>ORACLE Table and Column Information Form is for rebuilding the table and column information for a 
      particular group of ORACLE tables (e.g. PS_DWHR_. . .) 
      <br> NOTE: If something goes wrong (e.g. the wrong tables are added) you can RECOVER the table and column information
      files by going to the DBFNDX.ZIP archive in \\DW_FILE_PRINT\DW_SHARE\WEB_SERVER_BACKUPS\ and extracting the following
      7 files: TAB_ORA.DBF, TAB_ORA.NDX, TABC_ORA.NDX, COL_ORA.DBF, COL_ORA.NDX, COLS_ORA.DBF, COLS_ORA.NDX; then just copy
      them back over to the F:\INETPUB\CGI-REXX directory on the web server.
  <LI>SYBASE Database List Form is for rebuilding the database list that appears on Form 2 of the SYBASE query builder
  <LI>ORACLE Database List Form is for rebuilding the list that appears on Form 2 of the ORACLE query builder
  </UL>
<LI><I>SYBASE TEST Query Form</I> - run SYBASE queries using test versions of the scripts
<LI><I>SYBASE KILL Query Form</I> - kill your SYBASE queries 
<LI><I>ORACLE TEST Query Form</I> - run ORACLE queries using test versions of the scripts (ALSO - choose from many different INSTANCES)
<LI><I>ORACLE KILL Query Form</I> - kill your ORACLE queries
<LI><I>Reporting Template Log Form</I> lets you do some ad-hoc queries against the Reporting Template Archive. You can 
search by Report Name, by User Name, or by Input String content. You can also choose one date or one month or a range
of dates. If you want to see the User ID you need to click on 'Here are the results in ASCII Tab-Delimited Format' when
you see the results (or you could choose the Excel format).
<LI><I>Reporting Template Maintenance Form</I> is where you can create a new report or change an existing one. To create
a new report you first need to have one or more (SYBASE) stored procedures prepared. There's lot of help embedded in the
reporting template maintenance forms. When you use this form you are affecting the DEVELOPMENT VERSION ONLY.
<LI><I>Reporting Template Report Parameters Form</I> lets you see the report parameters (including the text of that
report's Stored Procedures) for any report; they are listed in alphabetical order. You can also choose the Development,
Test, or Production version of the report.
<LI><I>Reporting Template Admin Form</I> is for moving the development version of a report to TEST or for moving
TEST to PRODUCTION.
<LI><I>Logquery Form</I> lets you do ad-hoc queries against the Reporting Template log database or the Query
Builder log database
<LI><I>Refresh the CUFSPARM table</I> is used when a CUFS Softclose has run but it ended late (after 6AM) and the
financial.reports.umn.edu Report Forms don't reflect the new 'month-end' date. This just runs a quick SQL to get the
(SYBASE) cufsrdb..cufs_parms row (it's a one row table).
<LI><I>Edit the Report Form Parameters</I> - lets you change the way the Report Forms look; you can change the title
of a particular section or change the list of reports that appear in that section; you can also redefine some of
the parameters to make the Test form different from the Production form. After editing the parameters you would hit
the 'Rebuild the Report Forms' button to actually change the forms.
<LI><I>Rebuild the Report Forms</I> re-creates the financial.reports.umn.edu Report Forms. You would use this  
after 'Refresh the CUFSPARM table' or after 'Edit the Report Form Parameters'.
<LI><I>Re-Create the Reporting Template GLOSSARY Pages</I> is used when the GLOSSARY.TXT file has been modified and 
then transferred back to the web server machine. This rebuilds all the little web pages that are linked to from the
'financial' reports.
<LI><I>Re-Create the Index Information for SYBASE</I> is for the SYBASE Query Builder. The information about which 
columns are indexed for which tables affects the AUTO-JOIN feature.
<LI><I>Re-Create the Index Information for ORACLE</I> is for the ORACLE Query Builder. The information about which 
columns are indexed for which tables affects the AUTO-JOIN feature.
<LI><I>Re-Create ORACLE Setup Table List</I> queries the PS_DW_SETUPTBL_LIST table in DWPROD. The results are used
to build the list of SETUP tables that appears on Form 3 of the ORACLE Query Builder
