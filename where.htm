<TITLE>Help For Creating Conditions</TITLE>
<B>The SELECT DISTINCT Checkbox is used to avoid having Duplicate Rows
in your Query Results.

<P>NOTE: For ORACLE queries, if you put a date constant in a condition it
<I>MUST</I> be in MM/DD/YYYY format (e.g. 11/03/1998). You don't need to put quotes
around it but it <I>MUST</I> be in that format.

<P>--- JOIN CONDITIONS ---
<br>JOIN Conditions are needed when more than one table is included in the
query. You pick a column in each table that is Common to both. Each table
in the Query must be included in a JOIN Condition.

<P>--- OTHER CONDITIONS ---
<br>OTHER Conditions are optional - they let you narrow-down the number of
rows to be returned.
<UL>
<LI>You choose a Column in the ListBox then you choose an Operator then you
type in a Value
<LI>Don't worry about putting quotes around the Value - this form will do
that AUTOMATICALLY for Text Columns
<LI>For EQUAL-TO, NOT-EQUAL-TO, LESS-THAN, NOT-LESS-THAN, GREATER-THAN, and
NOT-GREATER-THAN you just put in ONE VALUE
<LI>For IN and NOT-IN you put in TWO OR MORE VALUES SEPARATED BY COMMAS
(for example:  1000,2000,3000)
<LI>For BETWEEN and NOT-BETWEEN you put in TWO VALUES SEPARATED BY THE WORD
'AND' (for example:  1000 and 2000)
<LI>For LIKE and NOT-LIKE you put in a STRING SURROUNDED BY QUOTES -
LIKE and NOT-LIKE are for Text Columns Only
(for example:  'SMITH' or 'SMIT%' or 'SMIT_'  -  the second string means
anything that STARTS with 'SMIT'; the third string means anything that STARTS
with 'SMIT' and Has Exactly One More Character;  so 'SMITHE' would match the
second string but NOT the third)
